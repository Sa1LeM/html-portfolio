<h1>The best animes according to salem </h1>
<h2>My top 3 anime's of all time.</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>One piece</h3>
<p>One piece is the best anime of all time it has many cool arcs and many charachters plot twists and  it always manages to surprise you!</p>

<h3>Naruto</h3>
<p>Naruto is one of the best action-drama animes I don't like the "talk no jutsu" so much but even with it it still a very good anime with good fights and story. <br/>
I DO NOT CONSIDER BORUTO AS A CONTINUE TO NARUTO CAUSE THIS TRASH DOES NOT DESERVE TO TAKE NARUTO'S NAME</p>

<h3>bleach</h3>
<p>the worst thing in bleach is the square episodes and the number of fillers on it but other than that bleach is so suprior and cool anime </p>
